# NOTE: This game was originally developed in 2020 over a span of three weeks by a group of three friends. The aim was to explore Unity, procedural generation and different styles of games.

# D_O_T
D_O_T is a procedural planet editor and game that offers a blend of genres across three distinct stages:

1. **Flight and Shoot**: Pilot your spacecraft around the generated planet and shoot down enemies.
2. **Third-Person Sword Combat**: Engage in close-quarters combat, wielding a sword in a third-person perspective against various foes.
3. **Tower Defense**: Shoot from within your tower to defend against waves of enemies.
